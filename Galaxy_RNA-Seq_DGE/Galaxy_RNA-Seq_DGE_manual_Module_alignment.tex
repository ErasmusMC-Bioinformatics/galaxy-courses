\section{RNA-Seq: alignment}
To make more sense of the RNA-Seq data, we try to find the detected sequences back in a reference genome (this process is also referred to as mapping and aligning).
The reference genome should represent the most common sequence of the chromosomes of the human population.
Please read the first paragraph (3 scentences) of the following url: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_genome}
\begin{itemize}
	\item On how many individuals is hg19 based?
\end{itemize}
For RNA-Seq we need specialized RNA aligners, able to cope with gaps that originate from splicing.
There are quite some of these aligners around.
For this course we will make use the tool ``\textit{\underline{RNA STAR} Gapped-read mapper for RNA-seq data}''.
Load the aligner, select the settings as given in the figure below and leave the rest on default.
Create an alignment for both \textit{miR-23b (clean)} and \textit{control sample (clean)}. \\
\textbf{Note: alignment is a computational very very heavy task so do NOT re-run unless this is really necessary, otherwise you have to give a treat.}\\

Please rename the \textit{HISAT2 on ...} to ``\textit{HISAT2 on miR-23b}'' and ``\textit{HISAT2 on control sample}''.
If the alignments do not have their \textbf{database} set, change it to hg19 as follows:\\

To get some general alignment statistics, run the tool ``\textit{\underline{Flagstat} tabulate descriptive stats for BAM datset}'' on \textit{HISAT2 on miR-23b}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item How many reads are multi-mapping?
\end{itemize}
For now we have only seen FastQ data and some summaries. To get an idea of what has been measured during the experiment, we can visualise the alignment. So, in the HISAT2 step we have been looking into hg19 where these sequences can be found in the reference genome, and this information is stored in those bam files. Import from the Shared Data library (TraIT Galaxy Training Materials $\rightarrow$ TraIT Galaxy Training - 3: RNA-Seq Tuxedo Pipeline) the file ``\textit{ucsc\_refseq.gtf}'' into your history. Start the built-in visualization Trackster at one of the alignments (make sure the dataset has \textbf{hg19} as database because we aligned to that):\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{figures/alignment_03}\\
Give it a name, press \textit{Create} and you will see a yellow bar, indicating that the bam file is being prepared. This means that the bam file is being convert into a file format that the browser can visualize. \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/alignment_04.png}\\
When this job is done, and it looks like this, make sure you save it:\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/alignment_05.png}\\
To add the other alignment, press the \textbf{[+]}-button:\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/alignment_06.png}\\
Now select the other alignment and press \textit{Add} and save it again:\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/alignment_07.png}\\
Remark that this is truncated data and you are supposed to see barely anything in here. Go to \textit{chr16}, to region \verb|chr16:15696870-15745667|.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can you see where the introns and exons are located?
\end{itemize}
To help you answer this question, you can add ``\textit{ucsc\_refseq.gtf}'' that will visualize the exons and gene structure of a refseq gene annotation. It will only be visible if its database of the history item is set to hg19. Again, ensure this visualization is saved:\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/alignment_08.png}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Can you go to \verb|chr15:60688011-60688099|, and explain what is going on there?
\end{itemize}
In the last question you can clearly see that you can observe biological facts from alignments where you couldn't extract this from the plain fastq files. Because looking through these alignments is way to much work and prone to errors, we use these bam files for a variety of computer programs to estimate metrics. These metrics can be insert size, expression levels, indel ratio's, etc., that may be used to test different hypotheses.

%The insert size is the size between the mate pairs in the alignment. Since the fragments (original part of RNA) are size selected, this should also be reflect in the alignment. Leave Trackster and run the Picard tool: ``Insertion size metrics for pairedd data''.
