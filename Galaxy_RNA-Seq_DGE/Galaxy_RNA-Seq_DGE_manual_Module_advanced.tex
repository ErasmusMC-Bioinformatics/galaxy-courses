\section{Expression analysis advanced}
\subsection{Estimating gene expression}
For this practical we need a RNA-seq alignments we previously made in the basic expression analysis: ``\textit{... miR-23b.bam}''. If you did not do that practical, you can find it in the supplementary material: \\
\datalibrarydirrnaseqadvanced $\rightarrow$ \textit{miR-23b.bam (clean)}\\
Ensure that the file is annotated at reference genome hg19. To estimate expression in RNA-Seq, we can count the number of reads that are aligned to each gene from the list of candidate genes. Therefore you also need to import:\\
\datalibrarydirrnaseqadvanced $\rightarrow$ ucsc\_refseq.gtf\\
This list is provided as a GTF/GFF file.
There are a variety of tools available for counting reads.
FeatureCounts is one of the faster tools and it works directly using BAM files. If you search for:\\
``\textit{\underline{featureCounts} Measure gene expression in RNA-Seq experiments from SAM or BAM files.}''\\
in the Tools menu, you can find the wrapper by the name:\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/expression_01.png}\\
Before we proceed, we would like to know whether the analysis has been performed correctly. Therefore we take a look at featureCountsâ€™ output-summary file ``\textit{featureCounts on \ldots}'':
\begin{itemize}
	\item How many reads are \textit{Assigned}?
	\item How many reads are \textit{UnAssigned (sum of all)}?
\end{itemize}
Flagstat told us the alignment has 18258 or 19493 reads in total (different versions).
Please confirm whether this matches with the total number of reads in the featureCounts summary file.
If we want to look at a particular gene, we may truncate the large table and only show the row with the gene of interest.
To filter a tabular file we proceed with the following Galaxy tool: 
\textit{\underline{Filter} data on any column using simple expressions}:\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/expression_02.png}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item How many reads are aligned to ANXA2?
	\item What gene has the highest gene count (tip: use \textit{sort})?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Expression analysis: Low sequencing depth}
In the previous exercise we found which gene had the highest readcount, but what does it mean if this gene has a high read count in every sample? To say something about expression levels, we should say it in a context relative to other expression levels. Therefore, we need normalization and apply statistical testing. A popular package that allows to do this is EdgeR which in galaxy fits perfectly with featureCounts.

In the following analyses you will determine the differentially expressed genes in the MCF7-cell line between samples that have been treated with the hormone $\beta$-estradiol (E2) and those that were left as control. The data was originally used to benchmark the statistical power of replicates and does not reflect a certain disease state. However, it is a classical 2-class approach and a similar setup can be useful for cancer analysis. Before we proceed, please read the abstract of the following article:
\url{http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btt688}\\
Tip: Look up where MCF7 cell lines originate from if you don't know this.\\
\\
For this analysis we will make use of samples all taken from this cell line.
In the article it is stated that for differential gene expression analysis it is very important to have a high number of replicates per condition.
We will repeat a part of their experiment, to illustrate their findings. For this practical we have the readcounts for a sequencing depth of $\sim$30M (full), 10M and 5M, for each replicate, already made available.
Each analysis in this assignment will be to determine the number of differentially expressed (DE) genes and add this number to Table \ref{tab:dge_ad_01}:
\begin{table}[]
\centering
\caption{results of DGE analysis}
\label{tab:dge_ad_01}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | r | }
\hline
Replicates & Seq. Depth & Significant DE genes \\
\hline
0          & 0          & 0\quad\quad \\
7rep\_5M   & 5,000,000  & \verb|.......| ? \\
7rep\_10M  & 10,000,000 & \verb|.......| ? \\
7rep\_30M  & 30,000,000 & \verb|.......| ? \\
5rep\_30M  & 30,000,000 & \verb|.......| ? \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Import the following files from data library \datalibrarydirrnaseqadvanced :
\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \verb|GSE51403_expression_matrix_5M_coverage.txt|
	\item[] \verb|GSE51403_expression_matrix_10M_coverage.txt|
	\item[] \verb|GSE51403_expression_matrix_full.txt|
	\item[] \verb|GSE51403_expression_matrix_full_5x5.txt|
	\item[] \verb|GSE51403_design_matrix_subsampled.txt|
\end{itemize}
Please take a look at the file GSE51403\_design\_matrix\_subsampled.txt.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Given that the first column lists the names of the samples and the second column the samples' corresponding condition, how many conditions does the experiment have?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Subsampled datasets: 5M, 7+7}
We have a two classes problem: the class itreated with estradiol is called ``E2'', and the other called ``Control''.
The design matrix provides the mapping from the RNAseq counts per sample to the phenotype class each is associated with.
Take a look at the design matrix and see if you can find samples that belong to two mentioned classes.
\begin{itemize}
	\item [$\square$] Load ``\textit{\underline{edgeR: Differential Gene(Expression) Analysis} RNA-Seq gene expression analysis using edgeR (R package)}
	\item [$\square$] Choose \textbf{Analysis type}: \textit{Multigroup test and/or complex designs with e.g. blocking}
	\item [$\square$] Choose \textbf{Expression (read count) matrix}: {\scriptsize \verb| GSE51403_expression_matrix_5M_coverage.txt|}
	\item [$\square$] Choose \textbf{Design matrix}: \verb|GSE51403_design_matrix.txt|
	\item [$\square$] Define contrast: this is the more complicated part of the wrapper. It is defining the hypothesis we want to test. This is done via a mathematical formulation in a format described by a well known package \textit{limma}. For two class problems it is very simple: \textit{classNormal-classTreated} which in our case is: \textbf{Control-E2} (case sensitive!)
	\item [$\square$] Set \textbf{Report differentially expressed genes} to \textit{Only significant (defined by FDR cutoff)} and ensure the cutoff is set to \verb|0.01|.
	\item [$\square$] Don't select additional output files and leave the rest default.
\end{itemize}
It is always important to check whether what we did was correct. Take a look at the file ``\textit{edgeR DGE on 1: GSE51403\_design\_matrix.txt differentially expressed genes}''. If everything is correct, the gene \verb|GREB1| is located in the top of the file. Please check its corresponding gene cards page:\\
\url{http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GREB1}\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can you find on the gene cards page a regulatory factor of the gene that relates
to the E2 treatment?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hint: whxat was E2 again?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Can you find on the gene cards page an association with MCF-7 cells?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hint: what was MCF-7 for type of cell line again?
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The answers to the questions should confirm that what we find with the DGE analysis is in agreement with the setup of the analysis. In the output file, each line represents one gene indicated by the gene symbol in the 2nd column. The P-value is a probability that represents the chance to find the expression values that belong to the gene given that
they are from the same condition. The FDR is a multiple testing correction of the P-value and is usually used instead of the P-value. The lower this value, the less likely it is that the observed values are derived from the same condition. Thus, differentially expressed genes will have a low FDR and P-value. To distinguish between differences
considered to be caused by chance and differences that are that significantly large that they are considered to be from different conditions, we make use of a cut-off, commonly set to < 0.01 or <0.05.

In edgeR we have already selected to only return those genes with a FDR $\leq 0.01$. Hence, the number of lines in the history, minus 1 (header line) should give us the number of differentially expressed genes.
\begin{itemize}
	\item How many genes are significant differentially expressed between Control and E2? 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\square$] Please fill this in into Table \ref{tab:dge_ad_01}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Subsampled datasets: 10M, 7+7}
In the previous analysis, the FASTQ files contained a total of 5.000.000 reads per sample. For the next analysis we will make use of twice that amount of raw data: 10M reads per sample, 7 samples per condition.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [$\square$] Re-run the previous job with the rerun icon
	\item [$\square$] Replace \textbf{Expression (read count) matrix}: \textit{GSE51403\_expression\_matrix\_\underline{5M}\_coverage.txt} with \textit{GSE51403\_expression\_matrix\_\underline{10M}\_coverage.txt}
	\item How many genes are significant differentially expressed between Control and E2? Is this more or less than when we used 5M reads?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\square$] Please fill this in into Table \ref{tab:dge_ad_01}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Subsampled datasets: 30M, 7+7}
In the previous analyses, the FASTQ files contained a total of 5.000.000 or 10.000.000 reads per sample. The full data set contains more or less 30.000.000 raw reads per sample.
\begin{itemize}
	\item [$\square$] Re-run the previous job with the rerun icon
	\item [$\square$] Replace \textbf{Expression (read count) matrix}: \textit{GSE51403\_expression\_matrix\_\underline{5M}\_coverage.txt} with \textit{GSE51403\_expression\_matrix\_\underline{full}.txt}
	\item How many genes are significant differentially expressed between Control and E2?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\square$] Please fill this in into Table \ref{tab:dge_ad_01}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Subsampled datasets: 30M, 5+5}
We have now ran three tests with 7+7 replicates with different sequencing depths. To see what the effects are of sample replication, we should run the same analysis with a different number of replicates. To modify expression matrices within Galaxy (both concatenating and removal) we can make use of the tool ``\textit{\underline{edgeR: Concatenate Expression Matrices} Create a full expression matrix}''. We have used all our replicates in the previous analyses and so we can reduce the number of replicates to 5+5 by simply picking a subset:\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/expression_03.png}\\
This will create a truncated version of the expression matrix, only including the desired 5+5 replicates.
\begin{itemize}
	\item [$\square$] For convenience, rename the new expression matrix to:\\``\textit{GSE51403\_expression\_matrix\_full\_5+5\_replicates.txt}''.
	\item [$\square$] Re-run the previous edgeR DGE job with the rerun icon
	\item [$\square$] Replace \textbf{Expression (read count) matrix}: \textit{GSE51403\_expression\_matrix\_\underline{5M}\_coverage.txt} with ``\textit{GSE51403\_expression\_matrix\_full\_\underline{5+5\_replicates.txt}}''
	\item [$\square$] \textbf{Enable} the optional output: ``\textit{MDS-plot (logFC-method)}''.
	\item How many genes are significant differentially expressed between Control and E2?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\square$] Please fill this in into Table \ref{tab:dge_ad_01}.
	\end{itemize}	
\end{itemize}
Take a look at the MDS plot. If you want to understand all details about MDS plots you should do some research online. For now, what matters is that the distances between the samples in the plot should correspond more or less to the distances between the samples based on the expression of all (22.000) genes.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Do you see separation between the samples from E2 and Control?
	\item Could you think of an application where it would be desired to see separation between classes?
	\item Would you expect more or less differentially expressed genes if the experiment was done on individual patient samples instead of cell-line replicates?
\end{itemize}
Can you create a tab delimited file of Table 01, e.g. in notepad or Excel, and upload it as a 'tabular' file within Galaxy? If you are not able to create the file, you can pick it from the data library. Try to open it in Galaxy as Scatterplot (visualization on the history item) and discuss with other people about the impact of removing these 2 replicates on the statistical power:\\
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/expression_04.png}\\
\textbf{You are finished!}
\subsection{Bonus question}
In case you can't get enough of it, go to the Shared Data bonus section and answer the following question:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To which classes do the Unknown samples belong? (Tip: MDS / heatmap)
\end{itemize}
